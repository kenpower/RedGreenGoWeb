<h1>First failing test</h1>

Our first test might simply try to call a fizzBuzz function with the value `1`, if we do, we will have a compile error: `Error C3861 'fizzBuzz': identifier not found`. 
This is OK, this is probably the simplest test we can write that will fail. The failing test will tell us what to do next.

If code in a test fails to compile because we have not yet defined the class or methods, then that counts as a failing test. The first red test is below
```
// in file test.cpp
#include "pch.h"

TEST(FizzBuzz, CanCallfunction) {
	fizzBuzz(1);
}
```

## Making first test green

In order to make this test pass, we need to define a FizzBuzz class
  
  1. Right click on FizzBuzz project in Solution Explorer windows. Select add/"new item", select "Header File (.h)". Change the name to "FizzBuzz.h" and click "Add
  2. Normally we should also create a FizzBuzz.cpp file for the method bodies, but we will put the methods in the .h file to simplify stting up the tests.
  3. Define a FizzBuzz class by adding the following code to FizzBuzz.h

```
#pragma once

class FizzBuzz {

};
```
 
 We also needd to `include` the class into out test file. Add the following line to test.cpp:
 
```
#include "pch.h"
#include "../FizzBuzz/FizzBuzz.h"
```

Go to test menu, select "Run all tests". We should see one green test in the Test Explorer. Congratulation you have written your first passing test.

 ## Second test
 
 Check that given input of 1, it returns the string `"1"`,
