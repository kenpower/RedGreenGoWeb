<h1>First iteration through the TDD loop</h1>
<h2>Think</h2>

<p>...</p>
<strong>What do I want to do?</strong>

<h2>First failing test</h2>

<p>Our first test might simply try to call a fizzBuzz function with the value `1`, if we do, we will have a compile error: `Error C3861 'fizzBuzz': identifier not found`. 
This is OK, this is probably the simplest test we can write that will fail. The failing test will tell us what to do next.
</p>

<p>If code in a test fails to compile because we have not yet defined a function we need to use, then that counts as a failing test. The first red test is below
</p>

<pre><code>
  // in file test.cpp
  #include "pch.h"
  
  TEST(FizzBuzz, CanCallfunction) {
    fizzBuzz(1);
  }
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Making the first test green</h2>

<p>In order to make this test pass, we need to define a <code>fizzBuzz</code> function</p>
  
<p>We are going to add the fizzBuzz function inside the text.cpp file</p>
<p>Normally the "production code" (the code we are testing) should be in a separate project, 
  but as this is probably your first attempt at TTD, we will keep things as simple as possible</p>

<pre><code>
  #include "pch.h"

  void fizzBuzz(int number) {}
  
  TEST(FizzBuzz, CanCallFunction) {
    fizzBuzz(1);
  }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Run all the tests (CTRL-R, V). You should see one green test in the test explorer</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have made your first unit test pass.</p>

<h2>Refactoring?</h2>

<p>Looking for opportunities to refactor (remove duplicated code, make code easier to read and maintain) 
  is a mandatory part of TDD after your tests are green. But often, especially early on there are no obvious opportunities to refactor.
  Looking at our code right now, it is very few lines of code, and it is very simple. So no real need to refactor right now</p>
<p>
That ends our first TDD loop. we have written a simple failing test, written code to make the test pass(green) 
and have looked for opportunities to refactor.</form>
</p>

<h1>Second TDD loop</h1>
<h2>Second Failing test</h2>

<p>We are ready to write our second failing test. What is the simplest code we can write using 
  our <code>fizzBuzz</code> function that will fail?</p> The function is supposed to 
  return the number as a string if it is not divisible by 3 or 5. 
  So we will try to call it with the value `1` and we expect it to return a string.</p>

  <p>Write a new test called "ReturnsAString", which captures the return value from the function into a string variable</p>
  
  <pre><code>
    #include "pch.h"

    void fizzBuzz(int number) {}
    
    TEST(FizzBuzz, CanCallFunction) {
      fizzBuzz(1);
    }
    
    //New Test
    TEST(FizzBuzz, ReturnsAString) {
      std::string result  = fizzBuzz(1);
    }
  </code></pre> 

  <p>If we add the above test to our test suite, we should see a red underline and a failing build</p>

<p>This is now our second failing test</p>

<a href="https://github.com/kenpower/FizzBuzz/blob/4d2962088cde9a87a75f5d9d24056aaf879f18c5/FixzzBuzz-Test/test.cpp">Code on gitub</a>


<h2>Making the second failing test pass</h2>

<p>We need to fix the code in the <code>fizzBuzz</code> function to return the correct type. At the moment it returns <code>void</code>. 
  Fix it to return a <code>string</code>. We do the simplest thing possible to pass the test, in this case simply return the empty string to satisfy the compiler.
</p>

  <pre><code>
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      return "";
    }
  </code>
  </pre>

<p>Run all the tests (CTRL-R, V). You should see two green tests in the test explorer</p>

<h2>Refactor now</h2>
<p>Once we have green tests, it is time to look for refactoring. 
  The code is still too simple to warrant refactoring. We can move on. </p>

<h1>Third loop</h1>

<h2>Third test</h2>
<p>The <code>fizzBuzz</code> function is expected to return the number as a string if it is not divisible by 3 or 5.</p>

<p>We can use the <code>EXPECT_EQ</code> macro to test our function. 
    The first argument is the expected value, the second is the actual returned value. 
    If the two values are not equal, the test will fail. </p>

<p>Again write the simplest test we think will fail.  
  Check that given input of 1, it returns the string `"1"`.  
  The new Test, called "Returns_1_AsString" will look like this:</p>

  <pre><code>
    #include "pch.h"

    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      return "";
    }

    //... other two tests
    
    TEST(FizzBuzz, Returns_1_AsString) {
      std::string result = fizzBuzz(1);
      EXPECT_EQ("1", result); // test fails if the two parameters are not equal 
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>Run all the tests (CTRL-R, V). You should see two green and one red test in the test explorer.</p>

  <h2>Meet the expectations</h2>

<p>Write the simplest code to pass the test. make the function return `"1"`:</p>

<pre><code>
std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
  return "1";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Run all the tests (CTRL-R, V). You should see three green tests in the test explorer, Success!</p>

<p>At first sight, the code we wrote to get this test to pass looks wrong. Hard coding the expected
result into the return value might make this one test pass, but it is definitely not a solution to the general
problem we are trying to solve. But, in fact, we are is following the TDD process carefully here, which
requires that, when we have a failing test, we should make the simplest, most direct changes to the
production code needed to make the test pass (while keeping all the existing tests passing, too). This simple,
stupid-looking implementation is sufficient to get the project to a green bar state. Writing anything more
complicated than this would be unnecessary and wasteful right now.</p>

<p>This is an important part of TDD. We write the tests in advance of writing the code to force us to think
about the behaviour we need to implement as a black box. It makes us think about what the code should do
(because we need to understand that in order to write the test), while completely ignoring (for the moment)
the issue of how the code should do it. </p>
<p> If we are not happy with the simplistic implementation we have produced, then that
indicates a problem not with the production code, but with the test cases. The solution is not to write
production code that goes beyond what the tests say is needed, but to write new test cases that make clear
that this simplistic implementation is not sufficient.</p>

<h2>Refactor now?</h2>
<p>The code is still too simple to need refactoring. 
One could argue that the string "1" should be a constant, but it's hard to see the value in doing that right now. 
Lets leave it for the moment</p>

<h1>Fourth Loop</h1>
<h2>4th failing test</h2>
<p>We are ready to write our fourth failing test. What is the simplest code we can write using 
  our <code>fizzBuzz</code> function that will fail?</p>

 <pre><code>
  TEST(FizzBuzz, Returns_2_AsString) {
    std::string result = fizzBuzz(2); //pass '2' as argument
    EXPECT_EQ("2", result);
 </code></pre> 

 <p>The test fails as expected</p>

 <h2>4th green test</h2>
  <p> What is the simplest code we can write using 
    our <code>fizzBuzz</code> function that will pass?</p>

  <pre><code>
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      if (2 == number)
        return "2";
      return "1";
    }
    </code></pre>

  <p>The test passes as expected</p>

  <h2>Refactor</h2>
  <p> Some of you might now be already sensing the a pattern in the <code>fizzBuzz</code> 
    function that would make the code and work for more values. 
    The refactoring step is where we look for those patterns. 
    But will hold off refactoring for one more round, to see if the pattern becomes even more clear.</p>

  <h1>Fifth Loop</h1>
  <h2>5th failing test</h2> 
  <p>We've written tests to check what the <code>fizzBuzz</code> function return for for values 1 and 2. 
  It may be tempting to make the next test check what happens with '3'. But not so fast!.

  </p>

  <p>The fizzBuzz function is expected to return the number as a string if it is not divisible by 3 or 5. 
  So '3' is a 'special' case, it seems to be handled differently than 'normal' numbers like 1 & 2. 
  Jumping from 'normal' numbers to 'special' numbers is probably not the simplest thing we can do right now.
  Lets get 'normal' number working first, then we can think about how to handle 'special' numbers.</p>

  <p> The next simplest case then is 4.
  </p>

  <pre><code>
    TEST(FizzBuzz, Returns_4_AsString) {
      std::string result = fizzBuzz(4);
      EXPECT_EQ("4", result); 
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h2>5th passing test</h2> 
  <p>What is the simplest code we can write?</p>

  <pre><code>
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      if (4 == number)
        return "4";
      else if (2 == number)
        return "2";
      return "1";
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h2>Can we refactor now?</h2>
  <p>By now the pattern in <code>fizzBuzz</code> should be clear. There is obvious duplication</p> 
  <p>If we continued with the simplistic implementations we would end up with a stack of very similar 'if' statements.</p>
  <p>Time to refactor to generalise and remove duplication!</p>
  <p>It seems te code is simply converting an integer into its string representation. 
    This can be done several ways in c++, but a good way is to use <code>std::to_string(int)</code></p>
  <p>After refactoring:</p>
  <pre><code>
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      return std::to_string(number);
    }  
  </code></pre>

  <p>After refactoring, we need to re-run tests to check we haven't broken anything. All the test should still be passing.</p>

  <h1>Sixth Loop</h1>
  <h2>6th failing test</h2>
  <p>By now we should be fairly confident that our code works correctly for all 'normal' numbers.</p>
  <p>But we can never be certain. But we want to write the simplest test that will fail. 
    Maybe we unsure if our new code will handle double or triple digit numbers.
    It's very easy to write a test for that (just check that the test numbers are not divisible by 3 or 5).</p>):
  </p>

  <pre><code>
    TEST(FizzBuzz, Handles_multi_digit_numbers) {
      std::string result_11 = fizzBuzz(11);
      EXPECT_EQ("11", result_11);
      std::string result_101 = fizzBuzz(101);
      EXPECT_EQ("101", result_101);
    }
  </code></pre>

  <p>Our tests are still green. If we can't think of any normal numbers that will cause the test to fail, we need to think about special numbers</p>
  <p>The next simplest test that will fail is :</p>
  <pre><code>
    TEST(FizzBuzz, Returns_3_AsFIZZ) {
      std::string result = fizzBuzz(3);
      EXPECT_EQ("Fizz", result);
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h2>6th passing test</h2>
  <p>What is the simplest code we can write, to pass the test?</p>

  <pre><code>
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      if (number == 3)
        return "Fizz";
      return std::to_string(number);
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h2>6th refactoring</h2>
  <p>A simple refactoring is to put the string "Fizz" into a const (this might be overkill?)</p>
  <pre><code>
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
      if (number == 3)
        return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
      return std::to_string(number);
    }
  </code></pre>
  
  <h1>Seventh Loop</h1>
  <h2>7th failing test</h2>
  <p>The next test failing should be for other special numbers returning "fizz", so the next number is 6, also a multiple of 3</p>

  <pre><code>
    TEST(FizzBuzz, Returns_6_AsFIZZ) {
      std::string result = fizzBuzz(6);
      EXPECT_EQ("Fizz", result);
    }
  </code></pre>

  <h2>7th passing test</h2>
  <p>The simplest code to make this pass is straightforward</p>

  <pre><code>
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
      if (number == 3 || number == 6 )
        return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
      return std::to_string(number);
    }
  </code></pre>

  
  <h2>7th refactoring</h2>
  <p>At this point it should be clear that if we continue, we will end-up with a very long sequence of 
    comparisons inside the <code>if</code> statement. How can refactor the code to generalise the pattern?</p>
    <p>We want the <code>if</code> condition to be true for all multiples of 3</p>
   
    <pre><code>
      std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
        const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
        if (number% 3 == 0 )
          return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
        return std::to_string(number);
      }
    </code></pre>
  
    <h1>Eight Loop</h1>
    <h2>8th failing test</h2>
    <p>It looks like we have all multiples of 3 covered, so the next failing test should be 'Buzz'</p>
  
    <pre><code>
      TEST(FizzBuzz, Returns_5_AsBUZZ) {
        std::string result = fizzBuzz(5);
        EXPECT_EQ("Buzz", result);
      }
    </code></pre>
  
    <h2>8th passing test</h2>
    <p>The simplest code to make this pass is also straightforward</p>
  
    <pre><code>
      std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
        const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
        if (number% 3 == 0 )
          return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
        if (number ==5)
          return "Buzz";
        return std::to_string(number);
      }
    </code></pre>
  
    
    <h2>8th refactoring</h2>
    <p>We can already see that the way we handled the multiples of 3 can be used for multiples of 5. So reuse the pattern from previous refactoring</p>
     
      <pre><code>
        std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
          const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
          const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING = "Buzz";
          if (number% 3 == 0 )
            return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
          if (number % 5 == 0)
            return MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING;
          return std::to_string(number);
        }
        
      </code></pre>

<h1>Ninth Loop</h1>
<h2>9th failing test</h2>
<p>We are almost done. The final issue is numbers divisible by 3 and 5, these should return "FizzBuzz". </p>
<p>What numbers are divisible by 3 and 5? Thinking about it for a minute,
  numbers divisible by 3 and 5 must be divisible by 15</p>
<p>we can write a test as follow</p>
<pre><code>
  TEST(FizzBuzz, Returns_15_AsFizzBUZZ) {
    std::string result = fizzBuzz(15);
    EXPECT_EQ("FizzBuzz", result);
  }
</code></pre>

<h2>9th passing test</h2>
<p>The simplest code to make this pass is also straightforward. We will just copy the pattern from before</p>

<pre><code>
  std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
    const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
    const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING = "Buzz";
    if (number% 3 == 0 )
      return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
    if (number % 5 == 0)
      return MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING;
    if (number % 15 == 0)
      return  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING + MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING;
    return std::to_string(number);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Uh-oh. It's still failing. Why?</p>
<p>Double clicking on the failing test, shows us the the function is returning "Fizz" not "FizzBuzz". 
  Looking at the code, that makes sense as 15 ia a multiple of 3, the first <code>if</code> 
  condition is true for 15, so the function finishes and returns "Fizz" before it can 
  check for multiples of 15</p>
<p>We can fix this by making the 'multiple of 15' condition first.</p>

<pre><code>
  std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
    const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
    const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING = "Buzz";
    if (number % 15 == 0)
      return  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING + MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING;
    if (number % 3 == 0)
      return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
    if (number % 5 == 0)
      return MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING;
    return std::to_string(number);
  }
</code></pre>


<h2>9th refactoring</h2>
<p>There a couple of refactoring opportunities here.</p>
<p>The three conditions with the mod(%) operator are a little difficult to read and their intention may not be obvious.</p>
<p>That can be fixed by moving the condition into a function and letting the function name 
  describe the purpose of the statement</p> 
  <pre><code>
    bool isAMultipleOf(int number, int divisor) {
      return number % divisor == 0;
    }
    std::string fizzBuzz(int number) {
      const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING = "Fizz";
      const std::string  MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING = "Buzz";
      if (isAMultipleOf(number, 15))
        return  MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING + MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING;
      if (isAMultipleOf(number, 3))
        return MULTIPLE_OF_THREE_STRING;
      if (isAMultipleOf(number, 5))
        return MULTIPLE_OF_FIVE_STRING;
      return std::to_string(number);
    }
    
  </code></pre>

  <p>If this ws real production code, the final refactoring would be to move the 
    <code>fizzBuzz</code> function to a file or class of it's own 
    so that it could be used by other parts of the system, independently of the test code.</p>
  
<p>But for now we will finish this exercise.</p>
<p>We have used 9 iterations of the TDD cycle to produce tested, well designed and readable code. We hope you enjoyed the process and continue to use TDD in your projects going forward. </p>
